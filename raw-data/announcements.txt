Presentation preferences
Dear students,



As announced in today's lecture, you can enter your choice of paper via the following form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHtxjqAx_KfmKT0wjouChhRCpnATRza86WMAS03SdI5cMmbg/viewform?usp=header

Please submit your answers by the end of the week such that I can distribute the papers on Monday.



Just a small recap regarding the evaluation of the course:

your presentation and the way you answer the questions are graded. Part of the grade will be peer-evaluation within your group.
at the end of the lecture you will get a small test (online; please bring your laptop) on the topic of the lecture. This will be a multiple choice test and one open question. The goal of this permanent evaluation component is to stimulate active participation during the presentations of your fellow students. My aim is that these will be "easy points" for attentive students.
Due to the nature of permanent evaluation, you are expected to attend all lectures. If you do not attend, you cannot participate in the permanent evaluation for that lecture which will result in 0 for the test.



The final grade will be computed as follows:

3 points: small tests at the end of the lecture
5 points: presentation 1
5 points: presentation 2
7 points: poster/demo


Best regards,

Toon Calders

Paper assignments
Dear students,



Please find below the assignment of papers and groups. Everyone received a paper of their choice. For the dates it was unfortunately not possible to make a perfect assignment for everyone. I expect every group member to do part of the presentation and every presente to be familiar with all parts of the paper, also those that are presented by another group member.



I am aware that it may not always be easy working together with other students that do not necessarily share the same academic background. I hope (and expect), however, that most groups will be able to work together fine. Nevertheless, in case there are serious issues, please contact me in time and we will find a way to deal with the issue (for instance: as a last resort we could decide dividing up the paper into subtopics that can be handled by subgroups).



You are free to proceed as you prefer, but nevertheless here are some suggestions:

To get things started smoothly, I'd like to propose that for each paper the student that is listed first, initiates the first contact. 
A reasonable plan of approach could be:

Plan a first meeting to discuss the content of the paper; make sure everyone in the group has a good grasp of the content of the paper. Are there things that are unclear and need to be explored further by inspecting other sources?
Make a rough presentation plan; what exactly will you cover, which examples will you use (maybe construct new examples?) Divide up the work/work on it together.
Bring together everyone's contributions ; unify format, structure, style, level of detail.
Dry-run the presentation on beforehand.
A reasonable rule-of-thumb for an experienced speaker is to have roughly 1 slide per 2 minutes. Inexperienced speakers may want to use more slides, but avoid having more than 1 slide per minute. (Slides that together form an animation count as 1.)



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Lecture tomorrow (20/2) starts at 9:30
Dear students,



Given that there will be only one presentation tomorrow, the lecture will start at 9:30 instead of 8:30.

Second assignment
Dear students,



For the second assignment we will again work in groups of three students that will be assigned by me. Please indicate by tomorrow which papers have your preference. You find the form and the papers on Blackboard, under the folder "Papers Batch 2".



For the second assignment the planning is as follows:

19/3 : Pick a paper the latest tomorrow
20/3: You will receive your group and paper assignment
2/4: Submit a video of 20 minutes discussing one or a few of the main points of the paper. Your presentation does not have to cover the complete paper. When selecting what to present, take into account: focus (better to cover a few things in detail than many things superficially), significance of the selected topic(s) (Pick the important contributions in the paper; avoid niche details), coherence. For the video you may but do not have to film the presenter. It is perfectly fine to use, for instance, the record function in powerpoint to make the video.
3/4-18/4 (this is during the easter break): Everyone will get assigned one video from another group and formulate feedback and provide suggestions for how to improve the presentation. You are also requested to suggest one question you would like the students to answer.
21/4-25/4: your group will receive feedback from 3 other students and myself, and 3 questions. At this stage you may improve your presentation. For one of the 3 questions you receive, answer it in a separate video (Guideline: not more than 5 minutes is expected for the second video).




Best regards,

Toon Calders

Assignment papers and groups: batch 2
Dear students,



Please find below the groups and paper assignment for batch 2 of the papers. Please upload your videos on or before April 2nd in BlackBoard. Videos are expected to be about 20 minutes (+- 2 minutes). Once the videos are submitted, each of you will be assigned one for commenting.



Apart from 1 person who only selected one paper, everyone got a paper of their choice. Given that 19 students cannot be divided in more than 1 or less than 19 equally-sized groups without harming any of you, one group has 1 extra member. Their presentation can be 25 minutes instead of 20 minutes to accomodate for the extra team member.



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Videos for commenting and one question
Dear students,



Many thanks to all of you for submitting the videos for batch 2 of the papers in time. Each of you will now get assigned one presentation for commenting and posing one question. Please find below the assignment of presentations to each of you. This assignment is individual. That is, each person is expected to write an individual evaluation of the presentation.

These evaluations will not be anonimous, although when sharing the feedbacks with the groups I will not reveil which comment is from whom (but given that the assignment is known, privacy is limited). Be honest, but constructive in your feedback.

You are also expected to formulate one question about the paper. Make sure that your question allows for an answer of reasonable length (for instance: "Did they use GPT 3.5 or GPT 4o?" is not a good question as it can be answered in 1 second.)



Where to find what?

The presentations are in the folder "Videos for assignment 2" on the course page on Blackboard.
To upload your evaluation and question, there will be an assignment in the folder "Tests, peer evaluations and upload zone".
The paper that got assigned to you: see below.
Deadline for submitting the evaluation: 18/4 23:59.



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Course planning for the next weeks
Dear students,



Please find below the planning for the next weeks of the course:



Thursday 24/4:
8:30 Invited speaker Ewoenam Tokpo (former phd student, currently working as an ML-engineer at CrossLang)
After the invited talk I will introduce the third and last assignment
Wednesday 30/4:
9:00 Invited speaker Pieter Delobelle (Aleph Alpha). Pieter is one of the authors of the popular Dutch language model RobBERT.
No lectures on 8/5 and 15/5 ; time to work on the project
Week of 19/5 : final presentations


Also the third project will be a group project, but now you will be allowed to chose the group division yourself. The deadline for the third assignment is negotiable; groups with multiple project deadlines in May but few exams in June can propose a date in the exam period.



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Third assignment
Dear students,



The explanation that was given in class and the slides have been included on the course website (you will find it as the last point of "course content"). Please note that you are requested to send, by email, your group composition and your proposal to me by Sunday 27. (sending later is allowed, but then you will also receive your feedback later).



If there is any unclarity please do not hesitate to contact me. Ideally with concrete questions like: "We would like to do ...  Is his suitable for the third assignment."



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Poster presentation
Dear students,



Could each group please let me know if they plan to present their poster next week, or prefer to postpone (propose a date)?

In that way I can see a bit whether we may need 1 session or 2 sessions. Please also indicate which slot you would prefer: Wednesday 8:30-10:30 or Thursday 8:30-10:30.



Best regards,

Toon Calders

Posters
Dear students,



I received some questions regarding the format for the posters. Here are some answers.



As said before, it is not necessary to have a poster professionally printed; it is ok to have, for instance 8 A4-pages combined together. The format of a poster is typically A1 (59.4 x 84.1 cm), which corresponds to 8 A4 pages in landscape, organized in a grid of 2 (width) by 4 (height). If you prefer to have your poster in landscape, that's fine as well. But, to allow for maximal parallellism, please print your poster (either as one big poster, or as up to 8 A4's combined together). There will be tape and magnets available to attach the posters.



Some advice on how to create a poster can be found, for instance, here: https://guides.nyu.edu/posters ; diverse poster templates, here: www.posternerd.com . Alternatively you could use powerpoint and change the slide size in the design tab. An easy way to quickly generate a poster is then to copy-paste individual slides (as a picture) from another presentation into the poster. Alternatively, an example poster made by a former phd student of mine (in powerpoint) has been attached as an example.



Best regards,

Toon

Poster presentation dates
Dear students,



Please find the schedule below for the poster presentations. You are expected to actively participate during your own presentation slot. Attendance during the other slots is allowed, but optional.

Toon
