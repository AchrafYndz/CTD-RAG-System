Second assignment
Dear students,



For the second assignment we will again work in groups of three students that will be assigned by me. Please indicate by tomorrow which papers have your preference. You find the form and the papers on Blackboard, under the folder "Papers Batch 2".



For the second assignment the planning is as follows:

19/3 : Pick a paper the latest tomorrow
20/3: You will receive your group and paper assignment
2/4: Submit a video of 20 minutes discussing one or a few of the main points of the paper. Your presentation does not have to cover the complete paper. When selecting what to present, take into account: focus (better to cover a few things in detail than many things superficially), significance of the selected topic(s) (Pick the important contributions in the paper; avoid niche details), coherence. For the video you may but do not have to film the presenter. It is perfectly fine to use, for instance, the record function in powerpoint to make the video.
3/4-18/4 (this is during the easter break): Everyone will get assigned one video from another group and formulate feedback and provide suggestions for how to improve the presentation. You are also requested to suggest one question you would like the students to answer.
21/4-25/4: your group will receive feedback from 3 other students and myself, and 3 questions. At this stage you may improve your presentation. For one of the 3 questions you receive, answer it in a separate video (Guideline: not more than 5 minutes is expected for the second video).




Best regards,
