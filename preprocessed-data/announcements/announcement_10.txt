Please find below the planning for the next weeks of the course:



Thursday 24/4:
8:30 Invited speaker Ewoenam Tokpo (former phd student, currently working as an ML-engineer at CrossLang)
After the invited talk I will introduce the third and last assignment
Wednesday 30/4:
9:00 Invited speaker Pieter Delobelle (Aleph Alpha). Pieter is one of the authors of the popular Dutch language model RobBERT.
No lectures on 8/5 and 15/5 ; time to work on the project
Week of 19/5 : final presentations


Also the third project will be a group project, but now you will be allowed to chose the group division yourself. The deadline for the third assignment is negotiable; groups with multiple project deadlines in May but few exams in June can propose a date in the exam period.



Best regards,

Toon Calders
