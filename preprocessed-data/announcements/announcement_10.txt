Third assignment
Dear students,



The explanation that was given in class and the slides have been included on the course website (you will find it as the last point of "course content"). Please note that you are requested to send, by email, your group composition and your proposal to me by Sunday 27. (sending later is allowed, but then you will also receive your feedback later).



If there is any unclarity please do not hesitate to contact me. Ideally with concrete questions like: "We would like to do ...  Is his suitable for the third assignment."



Best regards,

Toon Calders
