Results for first presentation were mailed
Dear students,
The results for the first presentation were sent by mail to your university mail addresses. The preliminary results for the second presentation (the recording) will follow soon. The peer evaluations including the questions will be sent Saturday, once the deadline is over. For those who haven't yet submitted their evaluation: please do so by tomorrow.
Best regards,
Toon Calders
