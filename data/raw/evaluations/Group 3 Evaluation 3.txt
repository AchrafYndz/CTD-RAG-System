On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?
Marie Ndagijimana, Achraf Yandouzi, Liam Leirs

Grade: 16/20

Good answer to a relatively open question. I agree with the conclusion that the evolution is actually quite the opposite of what the authors envisioned. This conclusion is sufficiently supported by collecting different statistics on the energy for training models, data set sizes, etc. I also like the nuance in the answer, claiming that what is real understanding is poorly defined, making the question hard to answer. The example with good Friday is convincingly showing that sometimes things still go wrong. At the same time developments like chain-of-though reasoning are not ignored.
