Presentation preferences
Dear students,



As announced in today's lecture, you can enter your choice of paper via the following form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHtxjqAx_KfmKT0wjouChhRCpnATRza86WMAS03SdI5cMmbg/viewform?usp=header

Please submit your answers by the end of the week such that I can distribute the papers on Monday.



Just a small recap regarding the evaluation of the course:

your presentation and the way you answer the questions are graded. Part of the grade will be peer-evaluation within your group.
at the end of the lecture you will get a small test (online; please bring your laptop) on the topic of the lecture. This will be a multiple choice test and one open question. The goal of this permanent evaluation component is to stimulate active participation during the presentations of your fellow students. My aim is that these will be "easy points" for attentive students.
Due to the nature of permanent evaluation, you are expected to attend all lectures. If you do not attend, you cannot participate in the permanent evaluation for that lecture which will result in 0 for the test.



The final grade will be computed as follows:

3 points: small tests at the end of the lecture
5 points: presentation 1
5 points: presentation 2
7 points: poster/demo


Best regards,

Toon Calders
