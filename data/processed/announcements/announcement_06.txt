Assignment papers and groups: batch 2
Dear students,



Please find below the groups and paper assignment for batch 2 of the papers. Please upload your videos on or before April 2nd in BlackBoard. Videos are expected to be about 20 minutes (+- 2 minutes). Once the videos are submitted, each of you will be assigned one for commenting.



Apart from 1 person who only selected one paper, everyone got a paper of their choice. Given that 19 students cannot be divided in more than 1 or less than 19 equally-sized groups without harming any of you, one group has 1 extra member. Their presentation can be 25 minutes instead of 20 minutes to accomodate for the extra team member.



Best regards,

Toon Calders
