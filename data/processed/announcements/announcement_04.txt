No lecture 20/3 because of honorary doctorate Jure Leskovec
Dear students,



As announced during the last lecture, there will be no class for "Current Trends in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" this week to give everyone the opportunity to attend the master class of prof. Jure Leskovec. See the invitation below. You can register for the event, which is warmly recommended, via the following link: https://forms.uantwerpen.be/en/events/masterclass-leskovec/ .



For the next assignment (paper), I will send out the details in a separate mail in a moment.
