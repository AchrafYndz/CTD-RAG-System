Posters
Dear students,



I received some questions regarding the format for the posters. Here are some answers.



As said before, it is not necessary to have a poster professionally printed; it is ok to have, for instance 8 A4-pages combined together. The format of a poster is typically A1 (59.4 x 84.1 cm), which corresponds to 8 A4 pages in landscape, organized in a grid of 2 (width) by 4 (height). If you prefer to have your poster in landscape, that's fine as well. But, to allow for maximal parallellism, please print your poster (either as one big poster, or as up to 8 A4's combined together). There will be tape and magnets available to attach the posters.



Some advice on how to create a poster can be found, for instance, here: https://guides.nyu.edu/posters ; diverse poster templates, here: www.posternerd.com . Alternatively you could use powerpoint and change the slide size in the design tab. An easy way to quickly generate a poster is then to copy-paste individual slides (as a picture) from another presentation into the poster. Alternatively, an example poster made by a former phd student of mine (in powerpoint) has been attached as an example.



Best regards,

Toon
