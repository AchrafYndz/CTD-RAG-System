Group 5
Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback

Scores: ??/20
Norea Sjunnesson - Xhejms Galanxhi - Saartje Herman

=================================================================================================

Positive points:
- overall a good presentation covering all important aspects of the paper
- effective use of examples to illustrate important concepts.

A few points of attention, however:
- the illustrations and examples stayed very close to those that were used in the paper.
- sometimes too many irrelevant details were given (e.g., the exact dropout rate, how many epochs used in training, etc.)
- very few details on the reinforcement learning. Given the target audience, a bit more of a gentle introduction into what is RL could have been helpful.

Comments on presentation style:
Saartje: overall well-presented, presented part and participation in the discussion was relatively limited. When presenting avoid too much just reading what is on the slide.
Norea: well-structured, comprehensive, clear presentation
Xhejms: overall well-presented, when presenting graphs make sure to clearly explain what can be read in the graph.
