Can LLMS keep a secret? Testing privacy implications of language models via contextual integrity theory
Ilias Sarikakis, Xhejms Galanxhi, Martina Janeva

Grade: ??/20

Several concepts are not properly explained; some examples:
- What is a "Pew study"?
- What is Krippendorff's Alpha? It is likely beyond the scope of the presentation to explain the measure, but some information like is higher better, or lower better? And: what are typical cut-off values that are used to mark strong/weak agreement would have been very helpful.

For the different tiers, adding in some examples of instances and some examples of prompts and generated instances for those that were automatically generated, would have increased the understandability tremendously. In its current form the presentation remains quite abstract.

The presenter is mainly reading out the slides. It would have been helpful to add in some examples and visuals in the slides (eg some schematic of the generation process) and have the presenter explain the visuals.

Overall the question is answered correctly and completely, but not in the most optimal way. The answer is factual, but requires the audience to do additional lookups to completely understand the answer. This is because of on the one hand a lack of being self-contained (referring to external studies without specifying the main characteristics of the study) and on the other hand, the absence of concrete examples of prompts to generate instances and the instances themselves.
