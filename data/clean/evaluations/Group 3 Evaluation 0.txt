Dear students,

Please find attached the evaluation of your first presentation (the one in class).
Do not hesitate to contact me in case you have questions or remarks.

If you feel one of your team-mates made an exceptional contribution, let me know. 
Well-motivated nominations may result in an extra point for that team member.

Best regards,
Toon Calders

Achraf Yandouzi, Asima Bibi, Ilias Sarikakis
Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models

Scores: 
Achraf Yandouzi: ??/20 
Asima Bibi  ??/20
Ilias Sarikakis: ??/20

Rationale for score differentiation: 
- Asimi's part of the presentation was taken over by a team member. In a one-on-one discussion afterwards it became clear that Asimi's knowledge of the paper was at par with that of the team members.

=================================================================================================

Positive points:
- Very nice presentation; concise slides, focusing on the essence
- The presenters interacted with the audience.

A few points of attention, however:
- Experimental part covered in much detail; was quite repetitive. 
- A clear conclusion for the experiments was missing in the slides. It is unclear why so many experiments were presented if so few conclusions were drawn.
